/**
 * This package contains implementations of the service interfaces defined in the parent package.
 * 
 * <p>The classes in this package provide concrete implementations of the business operations
 * defined by the service interfaces in {@link tech.saintbassanaga.reviewsapi.services}.
 * They encapsulate the actual business logic, interact with the repositories to perform
 * data access operations, and implement the business rules of the application.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These implementation classes follow the Dependency Injection pattern, with dependencies
 * such as repositories being injected through constructors or fields. They are typically
 * annotated with Spring's {@code @Service} annotation to be automatically detected and
 * registered as beans in the application context.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key implementation classes in this package include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link tech.saintbassanaga.reviewsapi.services.impls.ProductServiceImpls}: Implements product management operations</li>
 *   <li>{@link tech.saintbassanaga.reviewsapi.services.impls.ReviewsServiceImpls}: Implements review management operations</li>
 *   <li>{@link tech.saintbassanaga.reviewsapi.services.impls.AdminServiceImpls}: Implements administrative operations</li>
 *   <li>{@link tech.saintbassanaga.reviewsapi.services.impls.AuthServiceImpls}: Implements authentication and user management</li>
 *   <li>{@link tech.saintbassanaga.reviewsapi.services.impls.AuditorAwareImpls}: Implements auditing functionality</li>
